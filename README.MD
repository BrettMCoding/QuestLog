A World of Warcraft based To-Do list

Stay productive. Remember: patience, discipline!

Click the "?" button for help!


The heart of this is the effort I put into faithful likeness of buttons, sound effects, and randomized, pointless XP gain upon task completion. Local storage is used to save your list for later use.

The CSS is reactive, and should fully support any device resolution.

This project also uses SortableJS to make the to do list re-organizable.

Written in HTML5/CSS/JS.
